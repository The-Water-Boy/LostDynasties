Hi
The folder that is named " unprocessed " is for assets that have not yet been made ready to put into unity.
in this folder each individuaal asset must have it's own folder and in that folder all it's required textures and the asset must be held within it.
When the textures have been put on the asset and all the required work is done it must then be made into a prefab and put into the " processed " file.

When prepping the assets it must be don in the asset prep scene.
